		title: "PANTHEISM",
		content:
			`Pantheism,
is (in my opinion) the most pragmatic and simple interpretation of the world.
\n\n
Pantheism is simple, because it is derived from truths, observations about
the world made by the collective of humanity. This means that there could be
facts that we have not uncovered yet, but pantheism will be logical before
and after that fact is discovered.
\n\n
Pantheism is pragmatic, because it does not revolve around unanswerable questions.
It is an acceptance of truths (and the search to uncover them).
\n\n
The words "real", "physical", and "exist" are synonyms to me.
The words "nature", "universe", "everything", "the laws of physics" and "God" are synonyms to me.
\n\n
Pantheism is derived from the following postulates:
\n\n
- the acknowledgement that our reality and our experience are real
\n\n
- the belief that others experiences and realities are also real
\n\n
I think therefore I am. If I had a thought, and know I had a thought, I just
have to believe in time and I can say that that thought existed then, and I exist
now.
\n\n
I have observed the passing of time and I accept what it is.
\n\n
The second postulate is - the belief that others experiences and realities are also real.
\n\n
The second postulate is fundamental, because it says that
we are all equal (in that we all exist).
\n\n
So, if there are many perceptions of the world that are valid, then the universe must
contain all of our experiences. Put another way, one human's experience is just
a part of the universe. This can also be stated as: there is objective truth.
\n\n
In set theory we would say if we have the elements: my_truth and your_truth
Then the universe must contain those truths {my_truth, your_truth} \sub {universe}
(read: the set my_truth, your_truth is a subset of the set of the universe)
Here, I am using subset as an analogy, there are other mathematical statements
that means "this math is contained in this other math" (For example: homomorphisms).

		title: "THE DETERMINISTIC NATURE OF QUANTUM MECHANICS",
		content: `In physics - quantum mechanics in particular - the state of the universe,
or a "subset" of it (one, two, or many particles), is described by a "state vector".
A vector is mathematical object that holds information. "State" in physics just
means "the information that fully describes the physical system". The state of
a system evolves DETERMINISTICALLY in quantum mechanics. This means that given
the state at one time, the state at any future point in time can be calculated.
In practice this doesn't work for the whole universe because we don't have a
complete theory of all of the forces, but no matter how the forces work, they
will obey the laws of quantum mechanics.
\n\n
The most common misconception in physics (other than mixing up "speeding up" and
"slowing down") is the idea of the "wavefunction collapse". I have complaints
about the misnomer "wavefunction", but "wavefunction" is a name for the state
vector*.
\n\n
The "wavefunction collapse" refers to experiments in physics that result in random
outcomes with deterministic probabilities (i.e. we compute the probability of
each event, make many measurements, do statistics, and validate our predictions).
The question is, why does the state (or wavefunction) describe all of the
information, but the outcome of the measurement is random. The reason is more
simple than I expected.
\n\n
*(note: functions can be vectors, but thats not important)
\n\n
The simplest example of a quantum mechanical measurement is known as the "Stern
and Gerlache" experiment. This experiment has two possible outcomes known as "up"
and "down". The details of the physics are elaborate but the facts are simple.
You send a particle through a box (the measurement device) that gives you out
either "up" or "down" as a result with 50-50 probability
(https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/stern-gerlach). The process is, the
particle goes in, interacts with the measurement device, and then comes out in
either the up or down state. This is where the logical fallacy of the
"wavefunction collapse" (or Copenhagen interpretation) is found. If the
measurement device and the particle interact, then the physical system is not
just the particle, it also includes the measurement device. Luckily, the
mathematical framework of quantum mechanics allows us to represent this.
But we have to represent the system in a way such that the outcome of the
particle is in either the "up" or "down" state. In order to represent this in
quantum mechanics, we would have to know the initial state of both the particle
AND THE MEASUREMENT DEVICE. But we only know the incoming state of the particle.
Again our mathematic framework can handle this. What we do is we look at what
happens if we know the initial state of the particle and the device is in an
arbitrary state (we represent the generic state that could be anything, using
variables that would be unknown). We then evolve the system (which happens
deterministically) and then we get rid of the information about the measurement
device (this can be done in a mathematically rigorous way) and the final result
is that the outcome is probabilistic (50-50 for the stern and Gerlache)
\n\n
Conservation of energy is equivalent to the conservation of information.

		title: "MORALITY AND WORLD AGENDA",
		content:
			`I follow the moral idealization of utilitarianism (the moral philosophy). The
goal is to work toward the most happiness in the world. Though the philosophy
cannot be implemented in practice, I think that this is the right goal.
\n\n
Our existence is the experience of reality. With that comes pleasure as well
as pain. I personally prefer pleasure, as I believe is the intention of our
feedback responses. Therefore, my goal is to make the world a better place for
everyone to experience pleasure.
\n\n
I must acknowledge my privilege in life. I have grown up in the U.S. and I have
not have to struggle for sustenance or my place to life and therefore I have
been able to experience a lot of pleasure in my life.
\n\n
Pleasure can be indulgent, but it is not bad. We should balance our personal
pleasure with the ramification of the actions. For example, one who becomes very
rich can experience a lot of pleasure, but this could come at the sacrifice of many
others. This is something we must balance in the technological era.
\n\n
We clearly have domain over the planet. We live in a globalized, post-Internet
and technological world. Where should we go now? Whats next?
\n\n
Well, it seems like the most obvious thing is ending world hunger, but I want
to address a list of basic globalized civilization goals:
\n\n
  - Provide everyone with food and water.
\n\n
  - Provide everyone with housing.
\n\n
  - Provide everyone with health-care.
\n\n
  - Provide everyone with education.
\n\n
  - Obtain sustainability.
\n\n
Government is the official way people work together. It is the basic idea of a
civilization. The problem is that it has, historically, been constructed on
military. Military is how governments have given people security and also increase
the need for other civilizations to obtain military. But, in a globalized world,
everyone can communicate and work together, and our weapons make war pointless.
If we can strive towards slowly improving our government and increase the things
it does for us, we could work to achieving these goals.
\n\n
It is important to reflect on the government and think about the things we do,
and do not like about it (ignoring taxes). The things we do NOT like are the things
that government is NOT supposed to do. And the things we DO like about the government
are the things it IS supposed to do.
\n\n
The trouble is that today, the people running the government run on that
problems with our government, promising to fix them by removing government
infrastructure. but out government infrastructure is great and has always been
helpful to us.
\n\n
I love taxes, at least in theory. It is horrible to think that so much of our
taxes can be wasted; however, that waste is because of the flaws with the government
that we need to address, but we need to build on our infrastructure. Taxes
are necessary to provide schools, fund science, public utilities, etc, etc. We would not
be in the technological era we are without government.
\n\n
Science is the government of understanding. It is the collective effort to
work towards achieving a better understanding of the physical world. Science
has given us computers (we couldn't have computers without understanding quantum
mechanics in solids).
\n\n
I am advocating for collectivism. Along with the belief of Pantheism and the
importance of everyone's happiness and prosperity ("making the world a better
place") comes the idea that we must work together in our efforts. We must
improve the world for our future selves, for the next generation, ext.
\n\n
We even have international government
\n\n
Modern technology is bringing us to the point that we could eliminate the struggle
for basic need in life, which has always been the goal of technology.
Society should focus much of its effort on sustainable agriculture and healthcare.
Humans have proven to be great workers, and it has been shown that everyone has
capabilities, though they are different from person to person. If we can allow
everyone the basic needs, such as in the lives of many people in the United
States, then everyone could work for greater purposes and have the freedom to
pursue happiness and success.
\n\n
It is difficult, and I do not think an implementation o "communism" would be the
best way to approach this goal. We already live in a socialist state with an
"open market". The government provides regulation on the market but does not
necessarily allocate the money. For example, food companies are heavily
government supported, but there are choices in the market.
\n\n
Though I do see that large corporations are taking over, it does not simply mean
this is bad, though is does make me worried as it does with many people. I
believe that the collectivist attitude is the only way humans have gotten where
they are. Though agriculture came with power imbalances, it was truly the
sacrifice of farmers that has led us to our market economies. Therefore, it
makes sense that large entities that have a lot of power must exist as
otherwise we could not have the market economy that we do.
